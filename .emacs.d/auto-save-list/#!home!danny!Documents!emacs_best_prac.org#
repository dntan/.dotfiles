#+TITLE: Best Practices for Emacs
#+Author:  DT
#+Description: What we should be doing!

* Best practices:

1. Use the emacs daemon and emacsclient
2. Use Dired file manager. C-x C-f /Quick terminal access -> vterm M-x vterm
3. Emacs is a graphical program: take advantage of image previews and variable fonts!
4. Don't use the terminal version of emacs. -> no benefit from running it in the terminal. (don't bother)
Only reason to use emacs in the terminal is via tty where there is no graphical server.

*** Use the built in emacs manual, help guides.
- Is there a guide on how to best use the help guides? e.g. with given examples. How do I set up line-numbers and configure
  what files line numbers get excluded from.
  e.g. like using the man pages on unix machines.
   
* Best Value prop:

** Developers: Magit
https://magit.vc/

Needs git preinstalled to work.
Needs git config to be set up to run the commands.
I'm thinkig about having a setup script for my machine that dose the git config --global setups. I don't want to have to re-type it
for every machine.
