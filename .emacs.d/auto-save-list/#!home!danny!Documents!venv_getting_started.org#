* python virtual environment (venv)
venv is part of the python standard library for using virtual environments in projects.

** General workflow
1. Run ~python -m venv project_venv~, Always create the venv within your project folder.
2. add your project_venv to ,gitignore.
3. Enter your venv with ~source project_venv/bin/activate~, this is specific to linux or macOS.
4. To exit the venv use ~deactivate~

** pip packages in a venv
- install all the pip packages you need for your project.
- pip freeze > requirements.txt
- note: if you want to install based off an existing requirements.txt you can ~pip install -r requirements.txt~


If you need to delete the venv, simply delete the project_venv folder. ~rm -rf project_venv~

Don't create project directories in the venv. the venv should be something to throw away.
