#+TITLE: Best Practices for Emacs
#+Author:  DT
#+Description: What we should be doing!

* Best practices:

1. Use the emacs daemon and emacsclient
2. Use Dired file manager. C-x C-f /Quick terminal access -> vterm M-x vterm
3. Emacs is a graphical program: take advantage of image previews and variable fonts!
4. Don't use the terminal version of emacs. -> no benefit from running it in the terminal. (don't bother)
Only reason to use emacs in the terminal is via tty where there is no graphical server.

   
* There is a slight annoyance with the line number pushing the rest of the text out!
