#+Title: Testing LaTeX in Orgmode
#+Author: Danny Tan
#+STARTUP: latexpreview
#+Description: This doc is for testing out LaTeX previews and discovering orgmode note taking for math topics.

* Different types of Org-mode and LaTeX setups

** (my current usage) - vanilla orgmode + texlive install and packages  in the background.

** suggested Emacs + AUCTeX + Yasnippet




\[
e^{i\pi} = -1
\]

  \[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

*** Its possible to preview the above LaTeX with C-c C-x C-l toggle 

\[\LaTeX \]


Here is some inline \(\LaTeX\) as we can continue on writing this sentence.

lets check out if we have a typesetting error?

\[\frac{x}{y}\]

need to look into :scale setting in the config file. the LaTeX renders are a little small for me to read in great detail.

\(\Sigma\) is representative of sum of

\(\sigma\) is representative of the standard deviation. certain measures away from the mean.

\(\mu\) is representative of the population mean.

\(r\) is the correlation co-efficient. how well the data fits the model. close to 1 is positive linear relationship
closer to -1 is a negative linear relationship.

\(z\) score measures how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is.

It can be calculated by:

\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]




mean of a sample can be represented as:

\[\overline{x}\]


Hello \(\bar{x}\) this and that is inline.

I'm not sure which is the preferred or correct one. light line/bar above?

It will be interesting to learn about set notation! its coming up soon in Unit: Probabilty.
I don't remember covering this in High School.

I'm surprised a lot of these topics are not common knowledge to most people. Or maybe they learn "about" it but never apply or practice
it to any degree.

I don't really have a need to export as LaTeX PDF document from orgmode right now. I just need the ability to take

* Set operations

A set is a collection of /distinct/ objects.

\(x = \{3, 12, 5, 13\}\)

\(y = \{14, 15, 6, 3\}\)

\(\cap\) is an *intersection* and can be a representation of *AND*

\(x \cap y = \{3\}\)


\(\cup\) is a *Union* and can represent *OR*

\(x \cup y = \{3, 12, 5, 13, 14, 15, 6\}\)

is it possible for me to draw a venn diagram with LaTeX? does it require additional packages?


** The Differences between sets

A = {5,3,17,12,19}
B = {17,19,6}

A - B = {5, 3, 12}

or

Relative complement of Set B in A

\(A \setminus B\) Yes! this LaTeX is set with \setminus

Things that NOT in A

NOTE: removing "6" from set A. doesn't do anything it remains without 6.





\(B \setminus A = B - A\)

\(B \setminus A = \{ 6 \}\)

null set has no objects in it.

** Universal Set

\(\cup  vs  \bigcup\)

\(U\) maybe thiss is the universal set?

or

\(\mathbb U\) ahhhh this is the universe set. \mathbb U is used as the LaTeX and bb stands for blackboard????

set of real numbers \(\mathbb R\)

rational numbers \(\mathbb Q\)

Integers \(\mathbb Z\)


Membership of a set?

e.g.

\[5 \in A\]

we can use \in for elements that are members of a set. and we can use the \notin for members not in a set.

\[65 \notin A \]



is it the same as \(\epsilon\) nearly???

\[\epsilon\]

\epsilon looks different.

*** Some equivalent set notation:

example

C = {-5, 0, 7}

\[C' = \mathbb U - C = \mathbb U \setminus C\]

above description:
C complement is equal to universe minus C subset which is also equal to universal set /relative complement/ of C

This is ALL the stuff OUTSIDE the C set.

** Subset, strict subset and superset

A = {1, 3, 5 ,7, 18}
B = {1, 7, 18}
C = {18, 7, 1, 19}

**** B is a subset A


 \[B \subseteq A\]

**** B is a "strict" subset

\[B \subsetneq A\]

everything thing in B is in A BUT everything in A is not in B.

\(B \subsetneq C\)
