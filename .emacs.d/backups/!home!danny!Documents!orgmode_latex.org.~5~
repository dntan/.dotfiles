#+Title: Testing LaTeX in Orgmode
#+Author: Danny Tan
#+STARTUP: latexpreview
#+Description: This doc is for testing out LaTeX previews and discovering orgmode note taking for math topics.

* Different types of Org-mode and LaTeX setups

** (my current usage) - vanilla orgmode + texlive install and packages  in the background.

** suggested Emacs + AUCTeX + Yasnippet




\[
e^{i\pi} = -1
\]

  \[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

*** Its possible to preview the above LaTeX with C-c C-x C-l toggle 

\[\LaTeX \]


Here is some inline \(\LaTeX\) as we can continue on writing this sentence.

lets check out if we have a typesetting error?

\[\frac{x}{y}\]

need to look into :scale setting in the config file. the LaTeX renders are a little small for me to read in great detail.

\(\Sigma\) is representative of sum of

\(\sigma\) is representative of the standard deviation. certain measures away from the mean.

\(\mu\) is representative of the population mean.

\(r\) is the correlation co-efficient. how well the data fits the model. close to 1 is positive linear relationship
closer to -1 is a negative linear relationship.

\(z\) score measures how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is.

It can be calculated by:

\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]




mean of a sample can be represented as:

\[\overline{x}\]


Hello \(\bar{x}\) this and that is inline.

I'm not sure which is the preferred or correct one. light line/bar above?

It will be interesting to learn about set notation! its coming up soon in Unit: Probabilty.
I don't remember covering this in High School.

I'm surprised a lot of these topics are not common knowledge to most people. Or maybe they learn "about" it but never apply or practice
it to any degree.
