*** I should start a org learning notes dir and then use git to manage the change then upload to github.

merge or rebase??? I don't know the difference. I think I need some simple workflows to follow first...










** SQL Essentials Certificate
Done! -> also came with a sponsored certificate sign off.

** GIT

Workflows:

1. I want to start a project on my local machine BUT then I want to track changes AND upload to an online repo.
2. I want to clone a project that I found online and work with in on my local machine? 
   
* How do I want to work / practice with code?

** OS Arcolinux
- A very enjoyable OS - Erik's arcolinux website/yt channel have helped me learn so much about linux.
- The stardard suite of applications available from the full arcolinux is fantastic.

** GIT / GITHUB
- Track code changes locally and push to remote repo for safe keeping and sharing
  
** Emacs
- build and maintain my personal config file
- Use it for thought process notes, design workflows review them
- study notes --> LaTeX and Org mode
- write code in emacs --> have autocomplete.
- run code from emacs? use a shell? eshell?

  How do I work with venv with python via emacs?
