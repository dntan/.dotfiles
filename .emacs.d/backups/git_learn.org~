* Learn git and github with Erik Dubois

This tutorial and workflow is for individuals not working with others.

** Phase 1 Github account
I have a github account already
dn-tan@hotmail.com
pw: cb20

** Phase 2 Create a repo
I created a public repo called ".dotfiles" under my github account.

https://github.com/dntan/.dotfiles

I then need to git clone this empty repo to my desktop.

copy over "setup.sh" and up.sh

read and study this shell files. they contain all the generic commands I need to use over and over again.
understand what they do and then run them.

The .sh files need to be runable so make sure we chmod +x <filename> <filename>
