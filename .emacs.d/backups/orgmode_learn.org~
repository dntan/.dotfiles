#+Title: Org mode basics
#+Date: <2024-06-15 Sat>


* Org basics for Danny:

** key learnings today:
shift+tab = fold or unfold all section headings
C-c + . = Insert a timestamp e.g. in the #+Date: metadata above

** How do I configure my org mode with custom key bindings?
- find a resource to learn this from DT or System crafters?

  


* Emacs and Emacsclient
- side note to set up emacs --daemon
  and use the emacsclient instead of regular emacs.
  Save on start up config load time once, and run multiple sessions of
  that emacs that don't require an individual session. e.g. if launched
  from the terminal it won't hold that terminal session.
