#+Title: Org mode basics
#+Date: <2024-06-15 Sat>


* Org basics for Danny:

** key learnings today:
shift+tab = fold or unfold all section headings
C-c + . = Insert a timestamp e.g. in the #+Date: metadata above

Should I store my emacs config and init.el file in the default ~/.emacs.d location?
or have it preferences to .config with all the other arcolinux configurations?

however during update or skel it may get removed. and I have to reinstate it every time

** How do I configure my org mode with custom key bindings?
- find a resource to learn this from DT or System crafters?

* Emacs and Emacsclient
- side note to set up emacs --daemon
  and use the emacsclient instead of regular emacs.

if the daemon is launched and a emacs server is running

we can use emacsclient -c -a 'emacs'

-c = new window
-a = alternative editor in this case we want to launch a regular emacs sesssion.


  Save on start up config load time once, and run multiple sessions of
  that emacs that don't require an individual session. e.g. if launched
  from the terminal it won't hold that terminal session.

** How can I make it easier to create src code blocks with a keybinding

YES! below is a built in feature with orgmode that once included it lets us create source blocks easily.



** We can toggle the STATUS of a heading with SHIFT + left or right
*** TODO something to do
*** DONE something is done

**** level 4! looks like this
