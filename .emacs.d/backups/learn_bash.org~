* Learn Bash Scripting

** How to get started with a minimal start

At the top of a .sh bash scripting file we need to let the system know to run this as a bash script.
we include a header #!/bin/basha

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #!/bin/bash
  sudo pacman -Syyu --noconfirm
#+END_SRC

To make a .sh file executable.
chmod +x filename OR foldername
