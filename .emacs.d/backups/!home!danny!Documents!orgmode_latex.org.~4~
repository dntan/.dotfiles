e^{i\pi} = -1

  \[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}

Here is some inline \(\LaTeX\) as we can continue on writing this sentence.

lets check out if we have a typesetting error?

\[\frac{x}{y}\]

need to look into :scale setting in the config file. the LaTeX renders are a little small for me to read in great detail.

\(\Sigma\) is representative of sum of

\(\sigma\) is representative of the standard deviation. certain measures away from the mean.

\(\mu\) is representative of the population mean.

\(r\) is the correlation co-efficient. how well the data fits the model. close to 1 is positive linear relationship
closer to -1 is a negative linear relationship.

\(z\) score measures how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is.

It can be calculated by:

\[
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]




mean of sample?

\[\overline{x}\]


Hello \(\bar{x}\) this and that is inline.
